=============
Overview:

What do we want to do?
-Character stuff:
	Stats-what ones will we use? How are they gained?
	Classes-what classes are there? What stats do they use?
	Skills-what skills are there? How are they gained? What do they do?
-Enemies:
	What enemies are there? For that matter, what are we going to do for encounters?
		Will encounters be from a "explore X" button or can you explore a map?
		If there is a map, what will it be? How will you move? Are encounters random or visible?
	What stats do enemies have? Just damage and HP or is there other stuff?
		(I am thinking we can have HP, attack, defense, experience, drops (items and money), maybe a few special resistances (immune to spells, ex.), and body parts (you stab it in the X) -Tanner
	Anything else?
-Items:
