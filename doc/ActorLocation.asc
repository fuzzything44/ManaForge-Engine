ActorLocation
==============

Defined in header link:./../src/ManaForgeEngine/Public/World.h[`<World.h>`]


== Explanation ==

An `ActorLocation` is a empty interface class for the sole perpose of giving the world to associate an link:Actor.html[`Actor`] to where it is stored in memory. 

This class is usually implemented alongside the link:World.html[`World`] class.

An `ActorLocation` is included in every link:Actor.html[`Actor`]. It is also used for registering actors through the link:World.html#_code_addActor_code[`World::addActor`] function.


== Constructors ==

An `ActorLocation` is returned from the link:World.html#_code_addActor_code[`World::addActor`] function, and is the only way to create one.
